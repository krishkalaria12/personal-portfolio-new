          Trying to make &apos;Hello World&apos; the new &apos;abc&apos; I am currently pursuing my
          Computer Science Engineering at VIT, Chennai. Technology excites me
          and I am always in awe of the change it drives in the world. Certain
          skills that I have worked with include Full Stack Web Development
          (Frontend , Backend , API , Database), . And what I might lack in
          skills I make up for with my determination to learn. Outside of tech,
          I am a tea lover, sports enthusiast and have spent my college days
          exploring and networking with different people. If you&apos;re looking for
          a dedicated Full Stack Web Developer with a proven track record of
          delivering top-notch applications, I would love to connect and discuss
          how I can contribute to your team&apos;s success. Feel free to reach out
          and let&apos;s create something amazing together!
